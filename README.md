# Assessing Structural Connectomes for Trait Classification in Adolescents

## Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning methods to predict behavioral phenotypes using structural connectome (SC) matrices and demographic data. The study explores how SC matrices, derived from imaging data, can enhance the predictive power for certain behavioral phenotypes, providing insights into the neural foundations of adolescent behavior.
